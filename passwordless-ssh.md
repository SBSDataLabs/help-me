### So i dont need to use a password each time i log on to servers via SSH 
* Followed these instructions https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id
* Only bump in the road was ensuring that the permissions on REMOTE: `~/USER` were set to 755. (sudo chmod 755 ~/USER) 
* I have no idea whether this was necessary but was sufficient and i dont think causes problems elsewhere
